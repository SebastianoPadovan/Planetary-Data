FORMAT
 Ideally, every entry should have the following format:
 
 G = 6.67408e-11 # Gravitational constant [m3/kg/s2] (Mohr et al., 2016).
 
 The comment should contain the description of the constant, its units between square brakets
 (use [1] for dimensionless values), and the reference, whenever possible, in parentheses.
